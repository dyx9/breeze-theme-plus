A customisable Gatsby blog starter

## About the template

This is an extension of a Gatsby templete [Breeze Theme](https://github.com/izackwu/gatsby-starter-breeze) by [Zack Wu](https://github.com/izackwu).

Some main changes compared to the original theme:

- Add a separate section `Portfolio` to display my portfolio work
- Integrate the `tag` page into the sidebar for simplicity
- The table of contents can automatically track the current section
- Add a form for contact
- Inproved mobile layout, e.g., a nevigation section at the top
- Add some animations / page transitions for aesthetic effects
- ...

First, it should be noted that the original author of this theme is [SumiMakito](https://github.com/SumiMakito) and [AmazingRise](https://github.com/AmazingRise) (initial design and improvements), while [Zack Wu](https://github.com/izackwu) was the first to port it to Gatsby.
